            Arnon Nampa (Thai: อานนท์ นำภา; RTGS: Anon Nampha, also spelt Anon Numpa; born 18 August 1984) is a Thai human rights lawyer and activist. He is renowned in Thailand for openly criticizing the monarchy of Thailand, breaking the country's taboo. He was initially regarded as a prominent human rights defender during his tenure as a human rights lawyer and later accumulated multiple criminal charges due to his active involvement in pro-democracy activism. He is considered to be one of the leading figures of the 2020–2021 Thai protests, co-leading reforms to the monarchy reform movement by non-elite people for first time in Thai history. He was detained without trial in 2020 for 24 days but after Prime Minister Prayuth Chan-o-cha declared to use all laws including Lèse-majesté to the protesters in November 2020, he had been detained for 110 days in first round of remanding. After he received bail just 2 months from June 2021, on 9 August 2021, he has been imprisoned again without trial for 99 days until today.
